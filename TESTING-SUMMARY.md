## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Duplicate Log Issue Resolution
- **Problem:** POST requests causing 25+ duplicate error logs
- **Root Cause:** Redirect loop where curl -L preserved POST method
- **Solution:** 
  - Changed redirects from `/branches` to `/branches/list`
  - Changed redirects from `/companies` to `/companies/list`
  - Added explicit list routes in both controllers
  - Used 303 status codes for proper redirect behavior

### 2. Character Encoding Improvements  
- **Problem:** Thai characters displaying as mojibake (�������)
- **Solutions Applied:**
  - Added accept-charset="UTF-8" to all forms
  - Set proper Content-Type headers with charset
  - Server-side charset configuration
