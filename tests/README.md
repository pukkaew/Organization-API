## Test Results

The CRUD test provides detailed output showing:
- ‚úÖ Successful operations (returning 302 redirects)
- ‚ùå Failed operations with status codes
- üìä Overall success rate and detailed failure analysis

Current CRUD test success rate: **58.3%**
- All form submissions work correctly (create, update, delete)
- Authentication and session handling functional
- Some persistence/timing issues with record retrieval
